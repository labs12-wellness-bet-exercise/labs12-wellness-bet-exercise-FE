### Frontend built using:

#### React

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

    * The associated documentation, community and 3rd party packages are excellent.
    * It is component based, allowing for individual sections to be updated without impacting the rest.
    * It is a tried and tested framework that plays nice with most other frameworks that are used.

### Styled using: Material-UI

React components that implement Google's Material Design.

    * Material-UI components work in isolation.
    * Clean design following standards Google has made widespread.
    * Simple installation and readily available to implement
    * Many great organizations are also using this massive and easy to implement package.
